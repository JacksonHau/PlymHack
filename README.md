## Purpose and Goals
What is the primary purpose of this website?
To connect individuals through engaging events, where they can discover, suggest and attend events which resonate with their interests. 

## Content Requirements
Who is the target audience?
Our target audience ranges from social butterflies who enjoy building connections to introverted individuals who desire to meet new people through a common interest, with the help of our recommended events. 

## What kind of content will your website feature?
The homepage has a modern look which clearly displays the upcoming events which one can join alongside a concise description. Further content such as a photo gallery of previous events can be found in the ‘menu’ -> ‘past events’ area, which showcases the success of these meetings. Feedback and suggestions are available to continuously improve the website.


## How often will the content be updated?
The goal is to make several events per week, allowing a range of activities to be chosen from for all types of audiences. Hence, the content will be updated and regulated weekly.

## Design Preferences
What style of design are you aiming for?
A modern design has been implemented with neutral colours which creates a soothing and warm atmosphere.

## What are your colour scheme and typography preferences?
Neutral colours have been used. The logo uses a ‘Cosmic Octo’ font while the rest of the homepage uses ‘Arial’ and ‘San Serif’. A variety of sizes has been included in headings, etc. to attract users and provide clarity to the interface. 

## Functional Requirements
What specific functionalities does your website need?
A sign-up and sign-in page has been included and will be required to verify participants. For further improvement, a search-bar and live chat support might be useful for assistance and to find content quicker.

## How will users interact with the website?
For navigation, users will be able to access several items on the menu bar such as the ‘home page’, ‘edit my profile’, ‘recommended events’, ‘upcoming events’, ‘past events’ and ‘suggest an event’. The feedback form allows users to contact us and provide improvements as well as explanations to their user experience. The sign-up form captures email addresses for account creation. 
For the most part, users will interact and scroll through the events and the visual content to enhance their understanding and interest regarding our event offerings.

## Technical Considerations
What platform will you use to build the website?
VSCode has been used since it is reliable and supports several programming languages. The languages we used are html, CSS and javascript.

## SEO and Marketing
What keywords or phrases should your website be optimized for?
Short-tail keywords such as ‘social’ and ‘friends’ have high search volume but would be very competitive. Long-tail keywords include specific phrases such as ‘crafting events to meet new people’ are less competitive and likely lead to higher conversion rates. Location-based keywords such as ‘cooking class in Plymouth’ will attract local traffic.
Tracking keywords on Google Analytics shows which words drive traffic to our website, which we can continuously update based on performance and trends.

## What social media platforms will you integrate into your website for marketing purposes?
At the start, we will use word of mouth (share with friends and direct network) to gain initial feedback. After considering and improving the website, it is likely to be published to the public where other social media platforms can be considered for marketing purposes. 

## Maintenance and Support
Who will be responsible for maintaining the website?
The team will collectively monitor and maintain the website, discussing, suggesting and building improvements depending on the role (such as design, programming, researching).

## What is your plan for regular updates and security patches?
Quarterly updates are ideal to ensure that a certain number of users have been reached, and a number of feedback has been made. Current security patches include sign-ins.

## Do you have a budget for ongoing website costs and upgrades?
The overall goal is to keep the website free and open to all, hence any updates will be made without cost. Some challenges might arise from this, including basic functionality, fewer security features and limited SEO tools, however this will be considered in further team meetings and quarterly updates.

## Legal and Compliance
Do you need any specific legal pages or disclaimers?
No legal disclaimers have been implemented; however, it is likely that a terms of service will be added since it outlines user rights and provides legal protection for us. Intellectual property rights can also be protected since it specifies the ownership of the content, preventing unauthorised use.

## Are there any compliance issues to consider?
We must ensure that there are no infringements to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. This has been considered, and we have decided to use license-free images from Unsplash, preventing the use of copyrighted pictures.
Analytics and Tracking

## How will you measure the success of your website?
